# Probabilistic Programming in Scala

This library implements a probabilistic programming language in Scala. It is currently a direct port to Scala of the method described in [Practical Probabilistic Programming with Monads][pppwm]. The `prior` and `Metropolis-Hastings` methods have been implemented. No examples / tests / documentation as yet.

Everything about this project, especially the name, is subject to change.
